 The experience of panAfricanists and Hope Ambassadors in helping to repair black Atlantic world torn apart by ingenuity must not be lost. Their memories inspires true belief, hope, and healing expressed through their culture, arts, politics, medicine and health, education, economy, justice system, technology, sport, and entertainment that reimagine worldmaking.
 
 As part of this process of preserving their memories, we retell and internationalize the strategies of students and youths movements in Nigeria since 1978 as part of the worldmaking agenda of building a just society.
